# eventmanager
Django project

An app for managing events. The user can register and create events with a title, description, location, time, etc. Other users can respond whether they would attend or no, as well as leave comments. They can see all public events on the homepage, and on the "My events" page they see events they are hosting, attending or invited to. There are private events which only invited users can see. The host can edit and delete an event. 
Users have profiles which they can edit.

The app works with a postgres database (set in a docker locally).
